## Getting Started

To set up and run PunkMail locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/punkmail.git
   cd punkmail
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add necessary variables (e.g., API keys).
   # THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL
   SMTP_USER= yourgmail@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS = yourSMTPpassword!

` Steps to get the # SMTP_PASS for Gmail:

Go to your Google Account settings.
Navigate to Security.
Under "Signing in to Google," enable 2-Step Verification if you haven't already.
After enabling 2FA, go to the App Passwords section.
Create a new app password, selecting Mail as the app and your device as the one you're generating it for.
Google will provide a 16-character app password, which is your SMTP_PASS. `



4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
